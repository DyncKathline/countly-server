We suggest that you use `countly.install.sh` to install Countly on a Ubuntu machine, or `countly.install_rhel.sh` if you are going to install Countly on Ubuntu. 

There's also `countly.user.install.sh` script which installs Countly as root, but spawns processes with countly user. This is experimental and should be used at your own risk.
